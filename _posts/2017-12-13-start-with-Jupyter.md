## Jupyter Notebook is better starting point than the Python Shell!

Traditionally, you start with installing Python and fire up a Python shell('>>>' is the Python prompt) and type *print("hello world")*.


Over the years, I observed that for the professionals who have experience in SAS/SQL/Excel etc and want to learn Python for Data Science, the best starting point is to install **Anaconda**. Anaconda packs the commonly used data science packages into a clean Python distribution. It is the easiest way to install Python if your interest is in the data science. 

Best of all, Jupyter Notebook is ready for you once you install Anaconda!

You can start your "hello world!" right away!
