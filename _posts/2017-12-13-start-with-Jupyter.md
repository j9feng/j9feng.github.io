## Inerested in Python? where to start?

Traditionally, you start with installing Python and fire up a Python shell('>>>' is the Python prompt) and type *print("hello world")*.


Over the years, I observed that for the professionals who have experience in SAS/SQL/Excel etc and want to learn Python for Data Science, the best starting point is to install **Anaconda**.
